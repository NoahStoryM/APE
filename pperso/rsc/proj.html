            &lsquo;Phant</a> &mdash; A library for the composition of
            privacy techniques in unsupervised clouds.
            <p> In cloud application, privacy risks are mainly
            addressed using one technique, making application limited.
            We consider that the composition of many techniques is
            much more effective and enables the development of
            expressive privacy-preserving cloud applications.
            &lsquo;Phant is a library for the correct composition of
            privacy-preserving techniques.<br/>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/rcherrueau/rastache">Rastache</a>
            &mdash; Racket implementation of
            <a href="http://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a>, logic-less
            templates.
            <p> Mustache can be used for HTML, config files, source
            code - anything. It works by expanding tags in a template
            using values provided in a hash or object. It is called
            "logic-less" because there are no if statements, else
            clauses, or for loops. Instead there are only tags. Some
            tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a
            series of values.
